# flutter_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

To build a mobile application using Flutter with the mentioned features, you'll need to set up a Flutter development environment and follow a series of steps. 
I'll provide a step-by-step guide to create the application.

1. First, I had installed Flutter by following the official Flutter installation guide:
https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

2. Then, I had installed Android Studio and then I had set up Android Emulator for testing.

3. Then, we need to click on create a new Flutter Project

4. Then, Inside the lib folder i had created 4 folders namely db for storing the notes into database, 
models folder to organize and manage the data in a structured way, page folder for editing thte content,
deleting the content and also for creating the content, and widget folder to describe how the UI 
should look and behave in response to user interactions or changes in the application's state. 

5. Inbuilt we get main.dart file when we have created a new flutter project. n Flutter, the main.dart
file serves as the entry point of your application. It plays a crucial role in initializing the 
Flutter framework and setting up the initial configuration for an application.  

6. So, by using android emulator we could select a device and after completion of the code we have to 
click on the device manager to see the working process of our application on the selected device.

7. Interact with the app to create, edit, and delete notes by following the app's UI flow. 
For example, you can tap on the floating action button to create a new note, tap on a note to edit it, 
or use the delete widget to delete a note.

8. In this way we can continue testing and interacting with the app on your device to explore its functionality.
